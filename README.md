-Full Stack Group Project over a 2 week sprint using React.js/Next.js for the front end and Python with Django Framework for the back end.
Working on this project during a time of discovery, we decided to focus on the handeling of logic and case conversions in the backend with the goal of clean API calls returning exactly what we needed to the front end.
